Yep, another Material Chip view library. Just because the Android Support library v 28.x is still in alpha and because no other chip library has been able to provide the simplicity I need (regardless of all their features).

You can download a [sample app here](http://j.mp/ChipViewSample).

# Including in your project
Frames is available via JitPack, so getting it as simple as adding it as a dependency, like this:

1. Add JitPack repository to your root `build.gradle` file
```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```
2. Add the dependency in your project `build.gradle` file
```gradle
dependencies {
    compile('com.jahirfiquitiva:ChipView:{latest version}@aar') {
        transitive = true
    }
}
```
where `{latest version}` corresponds to published version in   [![JitPack](https://jitpack.io/v/jahirfiquitiva/ChipView.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#jahirfiquitiva/ChipView)


## How to implement
